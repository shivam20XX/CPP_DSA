# C++ with DSA

This repository is a personal collection of C++ Data Structures and Algorithms, curated and implemented by me for my own learning, revision, and interview preparation.

## Whatâ€™s Inside

- Classic data structures: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, Heaps, Hash Tables, etc.
- Standard algorithms: Sorting, Searching, Recursion, Dynamic Programming, Graph traversals, and more
- Well-commented and organized C++ code for easy reference
- Useful for practice, quick revision, and building a strong DSA foundation

## Usage

1. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shivam20XX/CPP_DSA.git
   cd CPP_DSA
   ```
2. Compile and run any code:
   ```bash
   g++ filename.cpp -o output
   ./output
   ```

## Why this repo exists

- To have all important DSA code in one place, ready for interviews or coding practice
- To keep my C++ skills sharp and DSA concepts fresh
- For self-learning, notes, and experimentation

## Contributions

This is mainly for my personal use, but feel free to fork or use any code if it helps you!
